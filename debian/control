Description: Specialized graph vertex coloring library, development files
 ColPack is a package comprising of implementation of algorithms for
 specialized vertex coloring problems that arise in sparse derivative
 computation.  It is written in an object-oriented fashion heavily
 using the Standard Template Library (STL).  It is designed to be
 simple, modular, extenable and efficient.  Its primary application
 has been for use in automatic differentiation.
 .
 This package contains the development library, header files, and
 documentation.
